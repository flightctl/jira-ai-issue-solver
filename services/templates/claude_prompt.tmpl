1. First, examine any relevant *.md files (README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, etc.) in the repository (these might be nested so search the entire repo!) to understand the project structure, testing conventions, and how to run tests.
2. Analyze the task description and comments.
3. Implement the necessary changes to fulfill the requirements.
4. Write tests for the implemented functionality if appropriate.
5. Update documentation if necessary.
6. Make sure the project builds successfully before running tests.
7. Review the markdown files (README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, etc.) to understand how tests should be run for this project. These files might be nested inside directories, so search the entire repository structure.
8. Verify your changes by running the relevant tests to ensure they work correctly.
9. Provide a summary of the changes made.
10. IMPORTANT: Do NOT perform any git operations (commit, push, pull, fetch, etc.). Git handling is managed by the system.
