# Tool versions for CI/CD
# This is the single source of truth for all CI tooling versions
#
# Format: Simple KEY=VALUE (compatible with both bash 'source' and Makefile 'include')
# No file extension to keep it tool-agnostic
#
# When updating versions here, they will automatically propagate to:
# - .github/test-ci-locally.sh (local CI testing via source)
# - Makefile (via include directive)
# - .github/workflows/*.yml (GitHub Actions - validated at runtime)
# - Containerfile.lint (via build args passed from Makefile)

# Go version for GitHub Actions (major.minor only - gets latest patch)
GO_VERSION=1.23

# Exact Go patch version for local testing (must match what actions/setup-go installs)
# Check https://github.com/actions/go-versions/releases for what setup-go installs
GO_PATCH_VERSION=1.23.12

# golangci-lint version (must include 'v' prefix)
GOLANGCI_LINT_VERSION=v1.62.2

# Ubuntu version for local container testing
# Should match ubuntu-latest (currently 24.04)
# Check https://github.com/actions/runner-images for ubuntu-latest version
UBUNTU_VERSION=24.04
