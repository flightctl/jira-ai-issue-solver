// Package jobmanager coordinates job lifecycle for AI-assisted ticket
// processing.
//
// The Manager receives events from scanners, creates jobs, and enforces
// constraints including deduplication (one job per ticket), concurrency
// limits, retry policies, and circuit breaker protection. Jobs are
// dispatched to an [ExecuteFunc] for processing.
//
// Job state is in-memory. Durable state lives in the issue tracker
// (ticket status) and GitHub (PR existence). If the bot crashes, the
// crash recovery process re-queues stuck tickets on startup.
//
// # Retry semantics
//
// The Manager does not retry jobs itself. Scanners re-discover failed
// tickets (whose status reverts to "todo") during subsequent poll
// cycles and resubmit them. The Manager tracks per-ticket failure
// counts across submissions and rejects new submissions once the retry
// limit is exhausted.
//
// Test doubles are provided in the [jobmanagertest] subpackage.
